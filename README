def get_peer_node(username): # function name is get_peer_node
    username is getting the username of whos using the chat

    returns n
    it is getting the username and returning it as a user


def join_group(node, group): # function name is join_group
    node is the user
    group is the group chat the user is joining

    it adds the user to the group they are trying to join and prints it

def chat_task(ctx, pipe, n, group): # function name is chat_task
    ctx might be a structure or a bunch of code happening behind the scenes
    pipe might be a connection between my code (username, group, message) to the message system/module
    n is the user?
    group is the group chat the user is in

    checks the message type and matches the correct format and string to print



def get_channel(node, group): # function name is get_channel
    node is the user
    group is the group/text channel the user is trying to join

    returns zhelper.zthread_fork(ctx, chat_task, n=node, group=group)

    I think this makes or connects an actual text channel is the context code, gives the zthread_fork
    the chat_task function that the user uses, and connects the user to the corresponding channel/group
